The script output potential per atom using Stillinger-Weber potential are 4.3366 ev, while that of Tersoff potential is 4.629595.

Consequently the total potential of Tersoff also higer than that of Stillinger-Weber, 7999.9401 comparing to 7493.6448.

The lattice parameter used in two input script are the same (as it should because we want to compare two potential ,otherwise we are comparing apple with orange)
